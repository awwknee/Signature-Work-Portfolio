### [Helter Smelter](https://github.com/UnseenFaith/godotgamejam) 

 Helter Smelter was a collaborative effort to create a video game within a time limit for a game jam. Our team consisted of a designer, developers, artists, and a composer. Within our allotted time frame of one week and the theme "Forge", our team created an Overcooked genre game with a unique isometric pixel art style. This game jam was also an opportunity to learn about Godot, an open-source game engine for 2D and 3D games. 

In this game you play as Bart, an experienced Blacksmith who is having trouble keeping up with his customers' demands. Help Bart alleviate his newly found business by creating various weapons and armor — swords, shields, and staffs — and deliver them to needy customers. You'll need to work fast. The faster Bart completes his orders, the happier the customers are and the more points you'll receive. But don't forget about the looming time limit! Bart will only have a little bit of time to complete orders, and only a few minutes before he will have to close up shop for the day. 

### [LeagueBuddy 2.0](https://github.com/awwknee/LeagueBuddy-2.0) 

LeagueBuddy is an account manager for League of Legends. After many years of playing, it can become difficult to keep track of accounts players have and use. This program helps to alleviate that by creating a system to hold that information as well as some other useful applications: 

- Saves usernames and passwords, which can be used to one-click login with the client. 

- Saves important ranked data and updates it accordingly, which includes things like wins, losses, ladder points, and decay/demotion periods. 

- Allows users to view the champions a particular account owns or has purchased. 

- Create account-specific runes, pages, or spells that are automatically sent to the client when a playing is on that account. 

- Wish list specific items (champions, skins, etc.) a user wants and informs them when they go on sale. 

### [Minecraft Visor Mod](https://github.com/awwknee/visormod) 

Minecraft Visor Mod is a simple mod that alters the basic Minecraft HUD to include a visor similar to Lethal Company. This visor is intended to help people who have motion sickness while playing first person games. Many people suffer from motion sickness, and not all the usual methods of reducing it work for everyone. Motion sickness occurs when the eyes believe that you are in motion but the liquid in your ears is stationary. This tricks your brain into thinking that you've been poisoned. The visor that appears on screen at all times, slightly obstructing your view, to give your eyes a point of reference to help them agree with your ears that you are in fact not moving when playing the game.  

### [UST Book Fetch](https://github.com/awwknee/UST-Book-Fetch) 

UST Book Fetch was a project for Database Design to create a simple application that interacted with a database. We were given a long list of unnormalized data, and we were in turn expected to normalize that data, add it to a database, and create an application that can pull data from it and display it in a easy way to understand. The program was coded in Python, with a MySQL database to hold all of our data. The program allows for several different permissive accounts: 

Students: Are able to login into their existing accounts or create a new account, search for books, add books to cart, rate and review books, view and cancel orders, and checkout and purchase books. 
Customer Service Employes: Can view ongoing orders and create tickets to assist students with their profiles or orders. 
Administrators: Can create new universities, departments, courses and books. 
Super Administrators: Can view and delete existing employees and add new employees. 

### [St.Paul Crime Map](https://github.com/sethz202/St-Paul-Crime-Map) 

St. Paul Crime Map is a web application created to learn about RESTful APIs and other web technologies. In a previous project we created a local REST API using Node.js that allowed us to get information, filter it, and return it from a database back to the invoker. Using that local API, we created a frontend and wired it up with our local API to create a map of St. Paul where you can view crime in your local neighborhoods. For the frontend, we used Vue.js which helped us create an interactive map where you click on it and view specific information about the crime. After finishing this project, we were able to explore the data and found some interesting patterns: 

University of St. Thomas Crime Data
- There seems to be a trend of lower crime rates in the area of St. Thomas. The number of incidents in that neighborhood is much lower than other areas 

Murder in the last year
- There have only been 5 recorded homicides/murders in St. Paul in the last year. Two of them took place in the Payne/Phalen neighborhood 

Crimes Committed
- It seems like the most common crimes, in all areas, tend to be property crimes in St. Paul
